# Urbana Fleet Fuel Management

## Organization Name
Urbana Public Works
 
## Local Sponsor

## Overview
The City of Urbana Fleet Division manages credit cards used exclusively for fueling City-owned vehicles.  The credit card transactions collect data regarding the fuel station, amount of fuel, vehicle ID, vehicle mileage, etc.

## Problem Statement
Are there trends that suggest that certain gas stations are more or less expensive?  Are there trends about fueling behaviors?

## Evaluation criteria
- Comprehensiveness of data profiling and the creation of a generally applicable or reusable model
